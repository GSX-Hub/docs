# The Beginning - Version 0.1.0

ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

I write this looking back at where the app first started out, and I'm so pleased with how far it has progressed in just over two months.

Cast your mind back, if I may, to December 2024...

!!! quote "05/12/2024"
    New kid on the block here to share an upcoming project with you.

    If you're like me, there are times when you think you are all set up for a flight only to realise when you load in that you have forgotten a GSX profile. 
    Or even worse you have to scramble onto flightsim.to, find the right profile, download it, unzip, move and reload Couatl all whilst taxiing...

    Well, I think it's about time we start to make installing and managing profiles significantly easier, don't you?

ðŸ‘€ What a promising looking preview, huh?

I'm not going to lie, I thought this project might flop when I showed some previews, but I was seriously humbled by the initial reception.

The reception gave me a drive to get the ball rolling and to see where it might take the development. Whilst I'm not a gifted coder or developer, I wasn't going
to let it stop me from at least giving it a go - I'd got somewhere in the previews, why not push further?

And so begins the development cycle, albeit a little slow with University work taking priority, but the app was officially off and running.

But where to next?
